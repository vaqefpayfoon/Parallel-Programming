**A modern approach to building faster, more responsive, and asynchronous .NET applications using C#**

## What is this book about?
Whether you are developing for desktop, mobile, web, or the cloud, performance and responsiveness are key to the success of any application. This book will help every type of C# developer to scale their application to its usersâ€™ needs and avoid the pitfalls often encountered with multi-threaded development.

This book covers the following exciting features:

* Prevent deadlocks and race conditions with managed threading
* Update Windows app UIs without causing exceptions
* Explore best practices for introducing asynchronous constructs to existing code
* Avoid pitfalls when introducing parallelism to your code
* Implement the producer-consumer pattern with Dataflow blocks
* Enforce data sorting when processing data in parallel and safely merge data from multiple sources
* Use concurrent collections that help synchronize data across threads
* Debug an everyday parallel app with the Parallel Stacks and Parallel Tasks windows

The code will look like the following:
```
public async Task PerformCalculations()
{
    _runningTotal = 3;
    await MultiplyValue().ContinueWith(async (Task) => {
    await AddValue();
});
Console.WriteLine($Running total is {_runningTotal});
}
```
